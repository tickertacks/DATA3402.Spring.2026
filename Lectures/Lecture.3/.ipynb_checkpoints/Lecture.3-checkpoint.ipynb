The point isn’t to memorize every rule of checkers — it’s to practice **structured programming**: solving a big problem by breaking it into small, testable pieces.\n",

    "The goal of working through building a checkers game in this lecture is to demonstrate how we can build something complicated by solving smaller problems. Each solution to a small problem will be implemented as a function. Once a function is worked out and tested, we can treat it as an **abstraction barrier**—we no longer need to worry about the details of that specific problem when building larger pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break the problem down into smaller parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game representation:**  \n",
    "  We need a way to represent the game board and pieces in memory. Once this is defined, we can write a function that creates a game board with pieces in their starting positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game play (moves):**  \n",
    "  We need to take an existing game board and modify it according to a player’s desired move. Once this is worked out, we’ll have a function that takes a board and a move description and updates the board accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game display:**  \n",
    "  The in-memory representation of the game is not very human-friendly. We’ll write a function that takes a game board and displays it in a clear, readable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Player interaction:**  \n",
    "  We need a convention for how players specify their moves in a way that is natural and easy for humans to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overall game loop:**  \n",
    "  To actually play the game, we’ll need to:\n",
    "  - Create a new game board  \n",
    "  - Draw the game board  \n",
    "  - Ask the first player for a move  \n",
    "  - Update the board  \n",

    "Checkers is typically played on the same 8×8 board as chess. To play the game, we need to store the state of the game—that is, the contents of each square—in memory. A natural way to represent the board is as a matrix, where each element corresponds to a square on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use the following convention: a square is empty when the corresponding matrix element is `0`, and it contains a piece from player 1 or player 2 when the value is `1` or `2`, respectively.\n",

    "We may decide to change this convention later, so rather than hard-wiring the values `0`, `1`, and `2` directly into our code, we’ll use variables to store these identifiers.

    "\n",
    "- **Decompose** a big problem into smaller functions, and test each function as you go.\n",
    "- Use clear **data representations** (here: an 8×8 matrix) and named constants (`empty`, `player_1`, `player_2`) to make code readable.\n",
    "- Be careful with Python shortcuts like `[[x]*n]*n`: they can create **shared references**. Prefer a loop or a list comprehension for nested lists.\n",
    "- Store fixed mappings (like move offsets) in **data structures** (dictionaries) instead of hard‑coding logic everywhere.\n",
    "- Write helper functions to improve usability:\n",
    "  - a `draw_board` function for readable output\n",
    "  - input parsing (`parse_location`, `parse_move`) to validate and convert user input\n",
    "- A “game program” is usually just a **loop** that repeatedly:\n",
    "  1. shows state,\n",
    "  2. gets input,\n",
    "  3. updates state,\n",
    "  4. checks for termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next time (Lecture 4), we’ll package this code into a module and use recursion to start exploring a simple AI player.\n"
